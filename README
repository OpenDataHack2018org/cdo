CDO - Climate Data Operators
----------------------------

     This package contains the source code for CDO. This program
     was developed at the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology.
     CDO is a collection of Operators to manipulate and analyse 
     Climate model Data.
     Supported data formats are GRIB, netCDF, SERVICE, EXTRA and IEG.

     CDO is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2.
     Read the file COPYING in the source distribution for details.

Operators:

     There are more than 350 operators available. Read OPEATORS for
     a short overview of all operators.

Documentation:

     A detailed description of all operators can be found in: ./doc/cdo.pdf

     Online reference manuals:   cdo -h <operator>

Building and installing it:

     1. Run ./configure, with some options if you wish. The standard
        options are documented in the INSTALL file. The configuration
        script has some more options; type 'configure -h' to see them.
        The most interesting ones are the usual
        --prefix=<installation directory> and
        --with-netcdf=<netCDF root directory> to enable netCDF support.

     2. Do "make" to compile the program.

     3. (Optional) Do "make install", possibly as root if the destination
        permissions require that. This installs CDO in the directory
        specified during configuration. The default prefix is /usr/local.

Porting:

     This package was designed for maximum portability. It is written entirely
     in ANSI C, and will compile on most UNIX platforms.
