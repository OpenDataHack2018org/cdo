In order to rapidly generate high quality pictures from the data obtained from the existing CDO operators, 
the CDO has been interfaced with Magics++ library. As a first step,some new CDO plotting operators are created 
to cater to the most essential/ frequently used plotting features viz., graph,contour, vector. 
These operators rely on the Magics++ and generate output files in the various formats supported by Magics++.

Magics++ is the latest generation of the ECMWF's Meteorological plotting software MAGICS.Magics++ supports 
the plotting of contours, wind fields, observations, satellite images, symbols, text,axis and graphs (including box plots).
Data fields to be plotted may be presented in various formats, for instance GRIB 1 and 2 code data, gaussian grid,
regularly spaced grid and fitted data,BUFR and NetCDF format or retrieved from an ODB database.The produced 
meteorological plots can be saved in various formats, such as PostScript, EPS, PDF, GIF, PNG and SVG.

Magics++ provides a vast number of parameters to control the attributes of various plotting features. 
Keeping in view,the usability of CDO users, currently only a few of these parameters are supported and 
accessible to the CDO users as command line arguments for the respective operators. The users are requested 
to refer to the Magics++ library for detailed description of the various parameters available for the various features.
The description of the new plotting operators and the various arguments that can be passed for these operators 
is provided in the subsequent sections.

To explore these operators, the CDO should be build with "--with-magics" and "--with-libxml2" config options.
