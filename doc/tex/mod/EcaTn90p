@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} be a time series of daily minimum temperatures TN, and
@file{ifile2} be the 90th percentile TNn90 of daily minimum temperatures
for any period used as reference. Then the percentage of time where TN > TNn90 
is calculated.
TNn90 is calculated as the 90th percentile of daily minimum temperatures of a five 
day window centred on each calendar day of a given climate reference period.
Note that both TN and TNn90 have to be given in the same units.
The date information of a timestep in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing timestep in @file{ifile1}.

To compute the percentage of timesteps with a daily minimum temperature
greater than the 90th percentile of the daily minimum temperatures for
a given reference period use:
