@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} be a time series of daily minimum temperatures TN, and
@file{ifile2} be the 90th percentile TNn90 of daily minimum temperatures
for any period used as reference. Then calculated is the percentage
of time where TN > TNn90. Note that both TN and TNn90 must be given
in the same units.
The date information for a time step in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing time step in @file{ifile1}.

@BeginExample
To compute the percentage of time where the daily minimum temperature
is greater than the 90th percentile of the daily minimum temperature for
a given reference period, use:
