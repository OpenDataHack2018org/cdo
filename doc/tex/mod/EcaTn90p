@BeginDescription
Let @file{infile1} be a time series of the daily minimum temperature TN, and @file{infile2} be the 
90th percentile TNn90 of daily minimum temperatures for any period used as reference. 
Then the percentage of time where TN > TNn90 is calculated. TNn90 is calculated as the 90th percentile
of daily minimum temperatures of a five day window centred on each calendar day of a given climate
reference period. Note that both TN and TNn90 have to be given in the same units.
The date information of a timestep in @file{outfile} is the date of the last contributing timestep in @file{infile1}.

@BeginExample
To compute the percentage of timesteps with a daily minimum temperature greater than the 90th percentile 
of the daily minimum temperatures for a given reference period use:

   cdo eca_tn90p tnfile tnn90file outfile
