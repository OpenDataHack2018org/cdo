@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} be a time series of daily precipitation amounts RR,
and @file{ifile2} be the 90th percentile RRn90 of daily precipitation
amounts at wet days for any period used as reference. Then calculated
is the percentage of wet days with RR > RRn90. 
The date information for a time step in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing time step in @file{ifile1}.

@BeginExample
To compute the percentage of of wet days where the daily precipitation
amount is greater than the 90th percentile of the daily precipitation
amount at wet days for a given reference period, use:
