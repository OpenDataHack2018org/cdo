@Parameter = grid

@BeginDescription
Enlarge all fields of @file{ifile} to a user given grid. Normally only the last 
field element is used for the enlargement. If however the input and output
grid are regular lon/lat grids, a zonal or meridional enlargement is possible.
Zonal enlargement takes place, if the xsize of the input field is 1 and 
the ysize of both grids are the same. For meridional enlargement the ysize
have to be 1 and the xsize of both grids should have the same size.

@BeginExample
Assumed you want to add two datasets. The first dataset is a field on a global grid
(n field elements) and the second dataset is a global mean (1 field element).
Before you can add these two datasets the second dataset have to be enlarged to the 
grid size of the first dataset:
@BeginVerbatim
   cdo enlarge,ifile1 ifile2 tmpfile
   cdo add ifile1 tmpfile ofile
@EndVerbatim
Or shorter using operator piping:
@BeginVerbatim
   cdo add ifile1 -enlarge,ifile1 ifile2 ofile
@EndVerbatim
@EndExample
