@BeginOperator_replace
@Title     = Replace variables

@BeginDescription
The replace operator replaces variables in @file{infile1} by variables from @file{infile2} and write
the result to @file{outfile}. Both input datasets need to have the same number of timesteps.
@EndDescription
@EndOperator


@BeginExample
Assume the first input dataset @file{infile1} has three variables with the names geosp, t and tslm1
and the second input dataset @file{infile2} has only the variable tslm1.
To replace the variable tslm1 in @file{infile1} by tslm1 from @file{infile2} use:
@BeginVerbatim
   cdo replace infile1 infile2 outfile
@EndVerbatim
@EndExample
