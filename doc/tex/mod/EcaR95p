@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} be a time series of daily precipitation amounts RR,
and @file{ifile2} be the 95th percentile RRn95 of daily precipitation
amounts at wet days for any period used as reference. Then calculated
is the percentage of wet days with RR > RRn95. 
The date information for a time step in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing time step in @file{ifile1}.

@BeginExample
To compute the percentage of wet days where the daily precipitation
amount is greater than the 95th percentile of the daily precipitation
amount at wet days for a given reference period, use:
@BeginVerbatim
   cdo eca_r95p rrfile rrn95file ofile
