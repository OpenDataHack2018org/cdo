@BeginDescription
Let @file{infile1} be a time serie of the daily minimum temperature TN, and
@file{infile2} be the 10th percentile TNn10 of daily minimum temperatures
for any period used as reference. Then the percentage of time where TN < TNn10 
is calculated.
TNn10 is calculated as the 10th percentile of daily minimum temperatures of a five 
day window centred on each calendar day of a given climate reference period.
Note that both TN and TNn10 have to be given in the same units.
The date information of a timestep in @file{outfile} is the date of
the last contributing timestep in @file{infile1}.

To compute the percentage of timesteps with a daily minimum temperature
smaller than the 10th percentile of the daily minimum temperatures for
a given reference period use:
