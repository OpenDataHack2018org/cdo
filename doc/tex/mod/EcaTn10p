@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} be a time series of daily minimum temperatures TN, and
@file{ifile2} be the 10th percentile TNn10 of daily minimum temperatures
for any period used as reference. Then calculated is the percentage
of time where TN < TNn10.
TNn10 is calculated as the 10th percentile of daily minimum temperatures of a five 
day window centred on each calendar day of a given climate reference period.
Note that both TN and TNn10 have to be given in the same units.
The date information of a time step in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing time step in @file{ifile1}.

@BeginExample
To compute the percentage of time where the daily minimum temperature
is less than the 10th percentile of the daily minimum temperature for
a given reference period use:
