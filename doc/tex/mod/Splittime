@BeginDescription
This module splits @file{ifile} into  time steps pieces. The output files will be named
@file{<obase><xxx><suffix>} where @file{suffix} is the filename extension derived from the file format. 
@file{xxx} and the contents of the output files depends on the chosen operator.

Set this variable to NULL to disable the adding of a file suffix.

@BeginExample
Assume the input GRIB dataset has time steps from
January to December. To split each month with all
variables into one separate file use:
@BeginVerbatim
   cdo splitmon ifile mon
@EndVerbatim
Result of '{\tt dir mon*}':
