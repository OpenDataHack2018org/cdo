@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} and @file{ifile2} be time series of maximum and minimum
temperatures TX and TN, respectively. Then the extreme temperature
range is the difference of the maximum of TX and the minimum of TN.
Note that TX and TN have to be given in the same units.
The date information of a timestep in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing timesteps in @file{ifile1} and @file{ifile2}.
