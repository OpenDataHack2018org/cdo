@BeginOperator_intyear
@Title     = Year interpolation
@Parameter = years

@BeginDescription
This operator performs linear interpolation between two years
time step by time step. Appends four digits with the year to 
@file{oprefix} to form the output file names.
@EndDescription

@BeginParameter years
@Item = years
INTEGER  Comma separated list of years
@EndParameter
@EndOperator


@BeginExample
Assumed you have two monthly mean datasets over a year.
The first dataset has 12 time steps for year 1985
and the second for year 1990.
To interpolate the years between 1985 and 1990 month
by month use:
@BeginVerbatim
   cdo intyear,1986,1987,1988,1989 ifile1 ifile2 year
@EndVerbatim
Example result of '{\tt dir year*}' for netCDF datasets:
@BeginVerbatim
   year1986.nc year1987.nc year1988.nc year1989.nc
@EndVerbatim
