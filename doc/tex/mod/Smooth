@BeginOperator_smooth
@Title     = Smooth grid points
@Parameter = [options]

@BeginDescription
Performs a N point smoothing on all input fields. The number of points used depend
on the search radius (radius) and the maximum number of points (maxpoints).
Per default all points within the search radius of 1degree are used.
The weights for the points depend on the form of the curve and the distance.
The implemented form of the curve is linear with constant default weights of 0.25
at distance 0 (weight0) and at the search radius (weightR).

@BeginOperator_smooth9
@Title     = 9 point smoothing

@BeginDescription
Performs a 9 point smoothing on all fields with a quadrilateral curvilinear grid.
The result at each grid point is a weighted average of the grid point plus
the 8 surrounding points. The center point receives a weight of 1.0, the 
points at each side and above and below receive a weight of 0.5, and corner 
points receive a weight of 0.3.
All 9 points are multiplied by their weights and summed, then divided by 
the total weight to obtain the smoothed value. Any missing data points are 
not included in the sum; points beyond the grid boundary are considered to 
be missing. Thus the final result may be the result of an averaging with less 
than 9 points.
