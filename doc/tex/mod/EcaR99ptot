@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} be a time series RR of the daily precipitation amount at wet days (precipitation >= 1 mm)
and @file{ifile2} be the 99th percentile RRn99 of the daily precipitation amount at wet days for any period 
used as reference. Then the ratio of the precipitation sum at wet days with RR > RRn99 to the total 
precipitation sum is calculated. 
RRn99 is calculated as the 99th percentile of all wet days of a given climate reference period.
Usually @file{ifile2} is generated by the operator @file{ydaypctl,99}.
The date information of a timestep in @file{ofile} is the date of the last contributing timestep in @file{ifile1}.
