@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} be a time series of daily precipitation amounts RR,
and @file{ifile2} be the 99th percentile RRn99 of daily precipitation
amounts at wet days for any period used as reference. Then calculated
is the ratio of the precipitation sum at wet days with RR > RRn99
to the total precipitation sum. 
The date information for a time step in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing time step in @file{ifile1}.
