@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} be a time series of the daily mean temperature TG, and
@file{ifile2} be the 10th percentile TGn10 of daily mean temperatures
for any period used as reference. Then the percentage of time where 
TG < TGn10 is calculated.
TGn10 is calculated as the 10th percentile of daily mean temperatures of a five 
day window centred on each calendar day of a given climate reference period.
Note that both TG and TGn10 have to be given in the same units.
The date information of a timestep in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing timestep in @file{ifile1}.

To compute the percentage of timesteps with a daily mean temperature
smaller than the 10th percentile of the daily mean temperatures for
a given reference period use:
