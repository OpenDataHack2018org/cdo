@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} be a time series of daily mean temperatures TG, and 
@file{ifile2} be the 90th percentile TGn90 of daily mean temperatures
for any period used as reference. Then counted is the number of days
where, in intervals of at least nday consecutive days, TG > TGn90. The
number nday is an optional parameter with default nday = 6. A further
output variable is the the number of warm-spell periods longer than or
equal to nday days. Note that both TG and TGn90 must be given in the
same units.
The date information for a time step in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing time step in @file{ifile1}.
