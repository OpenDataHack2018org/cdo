@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} be a time series of daily mean temperatures TG, and 
@file{ifile2} be the 90th percentile TGn90 of daily mean temperatures
for any period used as reference. Then counted is the number of days
where, in intervals of at least nday consecutive days, TG > TGn90. The
number nday is an optional parameter with default nday = 6. A further
output variable is the number of warm-spell periods longer than or
equal to nday days. 
TGn90 is calculated as the 90th percentile of daily mean temperatures of a five 
day window centred on each calendar day of a given climate reference period.
Note that both TG and TGn90 have to be given in the same units.
The date information of a time step in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing time step in @file{ifile1}.
