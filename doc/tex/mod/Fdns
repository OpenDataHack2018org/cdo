@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} be a time series of daily minimum temperatures TN
and @file{ifile2} be a corresponding series of daily surface snow
amounts. Then counted is the number of days where TN < 0° Celsius
and the surface snow amount is less than 1 cm. The temperature TN
have to be given in units of Kelvin.
The date information of a time step in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing time step in @file{ifile}.
