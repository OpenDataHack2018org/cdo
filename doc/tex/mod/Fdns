@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} be a time series of daily minimum temperatures TN
and @file{ifile2} be a corresponding series of daily surface snow
amounts. Then the number of days where @math{TN} < 0 @celsius and the surface 
snow amount is less than 1 cm is counted. The temperature TN
have to be given in units of Kelvin.
The date information of a timestep in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing timestep in @file{ifile}.
