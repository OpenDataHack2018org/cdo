@Arguments = ifile1 ifile2 obase

@BeginDescription
This module calculates the time series of the principal coefficients for given EOF
(empirical orthogonal functions) and data. Time steps in @file{ifile1} are 
assumed to be the EOFs, Time steps in @file{ifile2} are assumed to be the
time series. 
There will be a separate file containing a time series of principal coefficients
with time information from @file{ifile2} for each EOF in @file{ifile1}. Files
will be numbered as @file{<obase>\_<neof>.<suffix>} where neof is the number of the
EOF (time step) in @file{ifile1} and suffix is a file-suffix derived from the 
current file format.

@BeginExample
To calculate principal coefficients of the first 40 EOFs of ifile, 
and write the to ofile, use:
@BeginVerbatim
   cdo eof,40 anom_file evec_file eof_file
   cdo eofcoeff eof_file anom_file obase
@EndVerbatim
The principal coefficients of the first EOF will be in the file
@file{obase\_000000.nc}

If the dataset @file{ifile} does not containt anomalies, process them first,
and use:
@BeginVerbatim
   cdo sub ifile1 -timmean ifile1 anom_file	
   cdo eof,40 anom_file evec_file eof_file
   cdo eofcoeff eof_file anom_file obase 	
@EndVerbatim
