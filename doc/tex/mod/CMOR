@BeginDescription

@C The CDO operator cmor reads the data with the internal IO library CDI
@C and writes the NetCDF result directly with the CMOR library.

The CDO operator cmor selects variables from @file{infile}
and writes them directly with the CMOR library.
Each output file contains a single output variable with there coordinates and metadata.
Much of the metadata written to the output files is defined in the table file.
The name of the output files are derived from the metadata.
The supported formats of the table file are CMOR2/ASCII and CMOR3/json.
These tables are typically made available from MIP web sites.

A comma separated list of "key=value" pairs with optional parameters can be specified.
These optional parameters can be set to overwrite all entries of a parameter table from the command line.
Entries with two leading underscores are used for cdo/cmor internal purposes.
CMOR itself uses entries with one leading underscore internally. The remaining k-v pairs are
used as attributes. Unknown (to CMOR) keys are simply copied as global attributes.
