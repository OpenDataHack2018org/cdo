@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile} be a time series of the daily precipitation amount RR in [mm] (or alternatively in [kg m-2]),
then the number of days where RR is at least 10 mm is counted. The date information of a timestep in @file{ofile}
is the date of the last contributing timestep in @file{ifile}.

@BeginExample
To get the number of days with precipitation greater than 10 mm for
a time series of daily precipitation amounts use:
