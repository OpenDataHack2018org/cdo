@BeginDescription
Let @file{infile} be a time series of the daily minimum temperature TN,
then the number of days where TN < 0 @celsius is counted. Note
that TN have to be given in units of Kelvin.
The date information of a timestep in @file{outfile} is the date of
the last contributing timestep in @file{infile}.
