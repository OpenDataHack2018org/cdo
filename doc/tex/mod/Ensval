@BeginDescription
This module computes ensemble validation scores and their decomposition such as 
the Brier and cumulative ranked probability score (CRPS). 
The first file is used as a reference it can be a climatology, observation or 
reanalysis against which the skill of the ensembles given in ifiles is measured. 
Depending on the operator a number of output files is generated each containing 
the skill score and its decomposition corresponding to the operator. 
The output is averaged  over horizontal fields using appropriate weights 
for each level and timestep in rfile. 

All input files need to have the same structure with the same variables.
The date information of a time step in @file{ofile} is the date of the first input file.
The output files are named as 
@file{<ofilebase>.<type>.<filesuffix>} where @file{<type>} depends on the 
operator and @file{<filesuffix>} is determined from the output file type. 
There are three output files for operator enscrps and four output files 
for operator ensbrs.

The CRPS and its decomposition into Reliability and the potential 
CRPS are calculated by an appropriate averaging over the field 
members (note, that the CRPS does *not* average linearly). 
In the three output files 
@file{<type>} has the following meaning:
@file{crps} for the CRPS, @file{reli} for the reliability 
and @file{crpspot} for the potential crps. The relation 
@BeginMath 
CRPS = CRPS_{pot} + RELI
@EndMath 
holds. 	  

The Brier score of the Ensemble given by @file{ifiles} with respect to the 
reference given in @file{rfile} and the threshold x is calculated. 
In the four output files @file{<type>} has the following meaning: 
@file{brs} for the Brier score wrt threshold  x; 
@file{brsreli} for the Brier score reliability wrt threshold x;
@file{brsreso} for the Brier score resolution wrt threshold x;
@file{brsunct} for the Brier score uncertainty wrt threshold x.
In analogy to the CRPS the following relation holds:
@BeginMath
BRS(x) = RELI(x)-RESO(x)+ UNCT(x).
@EndMath

The implementation of the decomposition of the CRPS and Brier Score follows 
  Hans Hersbach (2000): Decomposition of the Continuous Ranked Probability 
  Score for Ensemble Prediction Systems, in: Weather and Forecasting (15) 
  pp. 559-570. 

The CRPS code decomposition has been verified against the CRAN - ensemble 
validation package from R. Differences occur when grid-cell area is not 
uniform as the implementation in R does not account for that.

@BeginExample
To compute the field averaged Brier score at x=5 over an ensemble with 5 members 
@file{ensfile1-5} w.r.t. the reference @file{rfile} and write the results 
to files @file{obase.brs.<suff>}, 
@file{obase.brsreli<suff>},
@file{obase.brsreso<suff>},
@file{obase.brsunct<suff>} where @file{<suff>} is determined from the 
output file type, use
@BeginVerbatim
   cdo ensbrs,5 rfile ensfile1 ensfile2 ensfile3 ensfile4 ensfile5 obase
@EndVerbatim
or shorter using file name substitution:
@BeginVerbatim
   cdo ensbrs,5 rfile ensfile[1-5] obase
