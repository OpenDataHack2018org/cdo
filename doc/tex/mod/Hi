@BeginDescription
Let @file{infile1}, @file{infile2} and @file{infile3} be time series
of temperature, vapour pressure and relative humidity records.
Then a corresponding time series of resulting humidity index values
is written to @file{outfile}. The humidity index calculation is only
valid for a temperature of T >= 26Â° C and a relative humidity of
R >= 40 %. Whenever these conditions are not satisfied, a missing
value is written to @{outfile}. Note that the temperature have to be given
in degrees Celsius, the vapour pressure have to be given in TBD, and the
relative humidity have to be given in percent.
