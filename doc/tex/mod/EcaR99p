@BeginDescription
Let @file{infile1} be a time series RR of the daily precipitation amount at wet days (precipitation >= 1 mm)
and @file{infile2} be the 99th percentile RRn99 of the daily precipitation amount at wet days for any period 
used as reference. Then the percentage of wet days with RR > RRn99 is calculated. 
RRn99 is calculated as the 99th percentile of all wet days of a given climate reference period.
Usually @file{infile2} is generated by the operator @file{ydaypctl,99}.
The date information of a timestep in @file{outfile} is the date of the last contributing timestep in @file{infile1}.

@BeginExample
To compute the percentage of wet days where the daily precipitation
amount is greater than the 99th percentile of the daily precipitation
amount at wet days for a given reference period use:
@BeginVerbatim
   cdo eca_r99p rrfile rrn99file outfile
