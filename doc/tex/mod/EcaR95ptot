@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} be a time series of daily precipitation amounts RR,
and @file{ifile2} be the 95th percentile RRn95 of daily precipitation
amounts at wet days for any period used as reference. Then calculated
is the ratio of the precipitation sum at wet days with RR > RRn95
to the total precipitation sum. 
The date information for a time step in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing time step in @file{ifile1}.
