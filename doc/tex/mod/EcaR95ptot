@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} be a time series of daily precipitation amounts RR,
and @file{ifile2} be the 95th percentile RRn95 of daily precipitation
amounts at wet days for any period used as reference. Then the ratio 
of the precipitation sum at wet days with RR > RRn95 to the total 
precipitation sum is calculated. 
RRn95 is calculated as the 95th percentile of all wet days of a given
climate reference period.
The date information of a timestep in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing timestep in @file{ifile1}.
