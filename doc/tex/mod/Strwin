@BeginDescription
Let @file{infile} be a time series of the daily maximum horizontal wind speed
VX, then the number of days where VX > v is counted. The horizontal wind
speed v is an optional parameter with default v = 10.5 m/s. A further
output variable is the maximum number of consecutive days with maximum wind
speed greater than or equal to v. Note that both VX and v have to be given in
units of m/s. Also note that the horizontal wind speed is defined as the
square root of the sum of squares of the zonal and meridional wind speeds.
The date information of a timestep in @file{outfile} is the date of
the last contributing timestep in @file{infile}.
