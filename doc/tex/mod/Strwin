@Section   = Miscellaneous
@Arguments = ifile ofile
@Operators = strwin

@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile} be a time series of daily maximum horizontal wind speeds
VX, then counted is the number of days where VX > v. The horizontal wind
speed v is an optional parameter with default v = 10.5 m/s. A further
output variable is the maximum number of consecutive days with maximum wind
speed greater than or equal to v. Note that both VX and v have to be given in
units of m/s. Also note that the horizontal wind speed is defined as the
square root of the sum of squares of the zonal and meridional wind speeds.
The date information of a time step in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing time step in @file{ifile}.
