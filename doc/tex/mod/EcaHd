@Section   = Climate indices
@Class     = Climate index
@Arguments = infile outfile
@Operators = eca_hd

@BeginDescription
Let @file{infile} be a time series of the daily mean temperature TG, then the heating degree days 
are defined as the sum of @math{T1} - TG, where only values TG < @math{T2} are considered. 
If @math{T1} and @math{T2} are omitted, a temperature of 17@celsius is used for both parameters. 
If only @math{T1} is given, @math{T2} is set to @math{T1}. Note that TG have to be given in units 
of kelvin, whereas @math{T1} and @math{T2} have to be given in degrees Celsius.
The date information of a timestep in @file{outfile} is the date of the last contributing timestep in @file{infile}.
