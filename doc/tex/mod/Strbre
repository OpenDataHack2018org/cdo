@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile} be a time series of daily maximum horizontal wind speeds
VX, then counted is the number of days where VX is greater than or equal 
to 10.5 m/s. A further output variable is the maximum number of consecutive
days with maximum wind speed greater than or equal to 10.5 m/s. Note that
VX is defined as the square root of the sum of squares of the zonal and
meridional wind speeds and must be given in units of m/s.
The date information for a time step in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing time step in @file{ifile}.
