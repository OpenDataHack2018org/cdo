@BeginDescription
Merges grid points of all variables from @file{ifile2} to @file{ifile1} and write the result to @file{ofile}.
Only the non missing values of @file{ifile2} will be used. The horizontal grid of @file{ifile2} should 
be smaller or equal to the grid of @file{ifile1} and the resolution must be the same.
Only rectilinear grids are supported. Both input files need to have the same variables 
and the same number of timesteps.
