@Arguments = ifile ofile
@Operators = eca_pd eca_r10mm eca_r20mm

@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile} be a time series of daily precipitation amounts RR in [mm]
(or alternatively in [kg m-2]), then counted is the number of days where RR is at least @math{x} mm. 
eca\_r10mm and eca\_r20mm are specific ECA operators with a daily precipitation amount of 10 
and 20 mm respectively.
The date information of a time step in ofile is the date of the last
contributing time step in @file{ifile}.

@Parameter = x

@BeginDescription
Generic ECA operator with daily precipitation sum exceeding @math{x} mm.

@BeginOperator_eca_r10mm
@Title     = Heavy precipitation days index per time period

@BeginDescription
Specific ECA operator with daily precipitation sum exceeding 10 mm.
@EndDescription

@BeginOperator_eca_r20mm
@Title     = Very heavy precipitation days index per time period

@BeginDescription
Specific ECA operator with daily precipitation sum exceeding 20 mm.

@BeginParameter x
@Item = x
FLOAT   Daily precipitation amount threshold in [mm]
@EndParameter


@BeginNote
Please note, that precipitation rates in [mm/s] or [kg m-2/s] have to be converted to
precipitation amounts (multiply with 86400 s).
@EndNote


@BeginExample
To get the number of days with precipitation greater than 25 mm for 
a time series of daily precipitation amounts use:
@BeginVerbatim
   cdo eca_pd,25 ifile ofile
