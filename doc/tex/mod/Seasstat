@BeginDescription
This module computes statistical values over time steps of the same season.
Depending on the actual operator the minimum, maximum, sum, average, variance
or standard deviation of time steps of the same season is written to @file{ofile}.
The date information for a time step in @file{ofile} is the date of the last 
contributing time step in @file{ifile}. Be careful about the first and the last 
output time step, they may be incorrect values if the seasons have incomplete 
time steps.
