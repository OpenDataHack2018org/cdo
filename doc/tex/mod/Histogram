@BeginDescription
This module creates bins for a histogram of the input data.
The bins have to be adjacent and have non-overlapping intervals.
The user has to define the bounds of the bins. The first value
is the lower bound and the second value the upper bound of the
first bin. The bounds of the second bin are defined by the
second and third value, aso.
Only 2-dimensional input fields are allowed. The ouput file 
contains one vertical level for each of the bins requested.
