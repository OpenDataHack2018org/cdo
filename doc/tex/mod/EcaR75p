@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} be a time series RR of the daily precipitation amount at wet days (precipitation >= 1 mm)
and @file{ifile2} be the 75th percentile RRn75 of the daily precipitation amount at wet days for any period 
used as reference. Then the percentage of wet days with RR > RRn75 is calculated. 
RRn75 is calculated as the 75th percentile of all wet days of a given climate reference period.
Usually @file{ifile2} is generated by the operator @file{ydaypctl,75}.
The date information of a timestep in @file{ofile} is the date of the last contributing timestep in @file{ifile1}.

@BeginExample
To compute the percentage of wet days with daily precipitation amount greater than the 
75th percentile of the daily precipitation amount at wet days for a given reference period use:
