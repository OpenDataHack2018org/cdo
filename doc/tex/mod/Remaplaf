@BeginDescription
This module contains operators for a largest area fraction remapping of fields between grids in spherical coordinates.
The operators in this module uses code from the YAC software package to compute the largest area fraction.
For a detailed description of the interpolation method see @cite{YAC}.
The interpolation method is completely general and can be used for any grid on a sphere.
The search algorithm for this remapping method requires that no grid cell occurs more than once.

@BeginDescription
Performs a largest area fraction remapping on all input fields.

@Title     = Generate largest area fraction remap weights
@Parameter = grid

@BeginDescription
Generates largest area fraction remapping weights for the first input field and
writes the result to a file. The format of this file is netCDF following the SCRIP convention.
Use the operator @mod{remap} to apply this remapping weights to a data file with the same source grid.

@BeginEnvironment
@Item = REMAP_AREA_MIN
This variable is used to set the minimum destination area fraction. The default
of this variable is 0.0.
