@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile} be a time series of daily minimum temperatures TN,
then counted is the largest number of consecutive days where
TN < 0° Celsius. Note that TN have to be given in units of Kelvin.
The date information of a time step in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing time step in @file{ifile}.
