@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile} be a time series of the daily minimum temperature TN, then the largest number of
consecutive days where TN < 0 @celsius is counted. Note that TN have to be given in units of Kelvin.
A further output variable is the number of frost periods of more than 5 days.
The date information of a timestep in @file{ofile} is the date of the last contributing timestep in @file{ifile}.
