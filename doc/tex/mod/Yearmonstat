@BeginOperator_yearmonmean
@Title     = Yearly mean from monthly data

@BeginDescription
This operator computes the yearly mean of a monthly time series.
Each month is weighted with the number of days per month. 
The time of @file{ofile} is determined by the time in the middle of all contributing timesteps of @file{ifile}.

@IfMan
For every adjacent sequence t_1, ...,t_n of timesteps of the same year it is:

o(t,x) = mean{i(t',x), t_1<t'<=t_n}
@EndifMan
@IfDoc
For every adjacent sequence \begin{math}t_1, ...,t_n\end{math} of timesteps of the same year it is: \\
@BeginMath
o(t,x) = \mbox{\textbf{mean}}\{i(t',x), t_1 < t' \leq t_n\}
@EndMath
@EndifDoc
@EndDescription
@EndOperator


@BeginEnvironment
@Item = CDO_TIMESTAT_DATE
Sets the date information in ofile to the "first", "middle" or "last" contributing timestep of ifile.
@EndEnvironment


@BeginExample
To compute the yearly mean of a monthly time series use:
@BeginVerbatim
   cdo yearmonmean ifile ofile
@EndVerbatim
