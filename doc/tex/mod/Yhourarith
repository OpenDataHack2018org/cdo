@BeginDescription
This module performs simple arithmetic of a time series and one
timestep with the same hour and day of year. For each field in @file{ifile1}
the corresponding field of the timestep in @file{ifile2} with the
same hour and day of year is used. The header information in @file{ifile1}
have to be the same as in @file{ifile2}. Usually @file{ifile2} is generated
by an operator of the module @mod{YHOURSTAT}.
