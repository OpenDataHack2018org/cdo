@BeginDescription
This module performs simple arithmetic of a time series and a
time step with the same month of year. For each field in @file{ifile1}
the corresponding field of the time step in @file{ifile2} with the
same month of year is used. The header information in @file{ifile1}
must be the same as in @file{ifile2}. Usually @file{ifile2} is generated
by a call of the module @mod{YMONSTAT}.
