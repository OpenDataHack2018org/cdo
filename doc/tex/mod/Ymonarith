@BeginDescription
This module performs simple arithmetic of a time series and one timestep
with the same month of year. For each field in @file{infile1} the corresponding
field of the timestep in @file{infile2} with the same month of year is used.
The header information in @file{infile1} have to be the same as in @file{infile2}.
Usually @file{infile2} is generated by an operator of the module @mod{YMONSTAT}.
