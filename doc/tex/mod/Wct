@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} and @file{ifile2} be time series of temperature and wind
speed records, then a corresponding time series of resulting windchill
temperatures is written to @file{ofile}. Note that the temperature and
wind speed records must be given in units of °C and m/s, respectively.
