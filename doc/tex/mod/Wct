@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} and @file{ifile2} be time series of temperature and wind
speed records, then a corresponding time series of resulting windchill
temperatures is written to @file{ofile}. The wind chill temperature
calculation is only valid for a temperature of T <= 33 @celsius and a wind speed
of v >= 1.39 m/s. Whenever these conditions are not satisfied, a missing
value is written to @file{ofile}. Note that temperature and wind speed records
have to be given in units of @celsius and m/s, respectively.
