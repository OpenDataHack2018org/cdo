@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} be a time series of daily mean temperatures TG, and
@file{ifile2} be the 90th percentile TGn90 of daily mean temperatures
for any period used as reference. Then calculated is the percentage
of time where TG > TGn90. Note that both TG and TGn90 must be given
in the same units.
The date information for a time step in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing time step in @file{ifile1}.

@BeginExample
To compute the percentage of time where the daily mean temperature
is greater than the 90th percentile of the daily mean temperature for
a given reference period, use:

   cdo eca_tg90p tgfile tgn90file ofile
