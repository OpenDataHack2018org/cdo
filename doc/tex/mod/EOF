@BeginDescription
This module calculates empirical orthogonal functions of the data in @file{ifile}.
If operator @mod{eof} is chosen, the EOFs are computed in either time or spatial
space, whichever is the fastest. If the user already knows, which computation
is faster, the module can be forced to perform a computation in time or gridspace
by using the operators @mod{eoftime} or @mod{eofspatial}, respectively. This can enhance 
performance, especially for very long time series, where the number of time steps
is larger than the number of grid-points.
Data in @file{ifile} are assumed to be anomalies. If they are not, the behavior 
of this module is @bold{not} well defined. 
After execution @file{ofile1} will contain the eigen-values and @file{ofile2} the
eigenvectors.
Missing value support is not fully supported. It is only checked for non-changing
masks of missing values in time. Although there still will be results, they are
not trustworthy, and a warning will occur. In the latter case we suggest to 
replace missing values by 0 in @file{ifile}

@BeginExample
To calculate the first 40 EOFs of a data-set containing anomalies use:
@BeginVerbatim
   cdo eof,40 ifile ofile1 ofile2
@EndVerbatim

If the dataset does not containt anomalies, process them first,
and use:
@BeginVerbatim
   cdo sub ifile1 -timmean ifile1 anom_file	
   cdo eof,40 anom_file ofile1 ofile2	
@EndVerbatim
