@Name      = Input
@Title     = Formatted input
@Section   = Formatted I/O
@Arguments = ofile
@Operators = input inputsrv inputext

@BeginDescription
This modules reads time series of one 2D variable from standard input.
All input fields must have the same horizontal grid. The format of the 
input depends on the actual operator.
@EndDescription
@EndModule


@BeginOperator_input
@Title     = ASCII input
@Parameter = grid

@BeginDescription
Read fields with ASCII numbers from standard input and stores them
in @file{ofile}. The numbers that are read are exactly that ones which 
are written out by @mod{output}.
@EndDescription
@EndOperator


@BeginOperator_inputsrv
@Title     = SERVICE input

@BeginDescription
Read fields with ASCII numbers from standard input and stores them 
in @file{ofile}. Each field must have a header of 8 integers (SERVICE likely).
The numbers that are read are exactly that ones which are written 
out by @mod{outputsrv}.
@EndDescription
@EndOperator


@BeginOperator_inputext
@Title     = EXTRA input

@BeginDescription
Read fields with ASCII numbers from standard input and stores them 
in @file{ofile}. Each field with a header of 4 integers (EXTRA likely).
The numbers that are read are exactly that ones which are written 
out by @mod{outputext}.
@EndDescription
@EndOperator


@BeginParameter
@Item = grid
STRING  Grid description file or name
@EndParameter


@BeginExample
Assume an ASCII dataset contains a field on a global regular 
grid with 32 longitude and 16 latitudes (512 elements).
To create a GRIB dataset from the ASCII dataset use:
@BeginVerbatim
   cdo -f grb input,r32x16 ofile.grb < my_ascii_data
@EndVerbatim
@EndExample
