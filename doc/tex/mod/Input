@BeginModule
@NewPage
@Name      = Input
@Title     = Formatted input
@Section   = Import/Export
@Arguments = outfile
@Operators = input inputsrv inputext

@BeginDescription
This module reads time series of one 2D variable from standard input.
All input fields need to have the same horizontal grid. The format of the 
input depends on the chosen operator.
@EndDescription
@EndModule


@BeginOperator_input
@Title     = ASCII input
@Parameter = grid [zaxis]

@BeginDescription
Reads fields with ASCII numbers from standard input and stores them
in @file{outfile}. The numbers read are exactly that ones which are written 
out by the @mod{output} operator.
@EndDescription
@EndOperator


@BeginOperator_inputsrv
@Title     = SERVICE ASCII input

@BeginDescription
Reads fields with ASCII numbers from standard input and stores them 
in @file{outfile}. Each field should have a header of 8 integers (SERVICE likely).
The numbers that are read are exactly that ones which are written out by 
the @mod{outputsrv} operator.
@EndDescription
@EndOperator


@BeginOperator_inputext
@Title     = EXTRA ASCII input

@BeginDescription
Read fields with ASCII numbers from standard input and stores them 
in @file{outfile}. Each field should have header of 4 integers (EXTRA likely).
The numbers read are exactly that ones which are written out by 
the @mod{outputext} operator.
@EndDescription
@EndOperator


@BeginParameter
@Item = grid
STRING  Grid description file or name
@Item = zaxis
STRING  Z-axis description file
@EndParameter


@BeginExample
Assume an ASCII dataset contains a field on a global regular grid with 32 longitudes 
and 16 latitudes (512 elements). To create a GRIB1 dataset from the ASCII dataset use:
@BeginVerbatim
   cdo -f grb input,r32x16 outfile.grb < my_ascii_data
@EndVerbatim
@EndExample
