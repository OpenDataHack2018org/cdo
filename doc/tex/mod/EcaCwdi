@BeginDescription
Let @file{infile1} be a time series of the daily minimum temperature TN, and let @file{infile2} be the mean 
TNnorm of daily minimum temperatures for any period used as reference. Then counted is the number of days
where, in intervals of at least @math{nday} consecutive days, TN < TNnorm - @math{T}.
The numbers @math{nday} and @math{T} are optional parameters with default @math{nday} = 6 and @math{T} = 5@celsius. 
A further output variable is the number of cold waves longer than or equal to @math{nday} days.
TNnorm is calculated as the mean of minimum temperatures of a five day window centred on each calendar day 
of a given climate reference period. Note that both TN and TNnorm have to be given in the same units.
The date information of a timestep in @file{outfile} is the date of the last contributing timestep in @file{infile1}.
