@Arguments = ifile1 ifile2 ofile
@Operators = eca_cwdi

@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} be a time series of daily minimum temperatures TN,
and let @file{ifile2} be the mean TNnorm of daily minimum temperatures
for any period used as reference. Then counted is the number of days
where, in intervals of at least nday consecutive days, TN < TNnorm - T.
The numbers nday and T are optional parameters with default nday = 6
and T = 5° Celsius. A further output variable is the number of cold
waves longer than or equal to nday days. Note that both TN and TNnorm
have to be given in the same units.
The date information of a time step in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing time step in @file{ifile1}.
