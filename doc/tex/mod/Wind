@BeginOperator_dv2uv
@Title     = Divergence and vorticity to U and V wind

@BeginDescription
Calculate U and V wind on a Gaussian grid from spherical harmonic 
coefficients of relative divergence and vorticity. The divergence and vorticity 
need to have the names sd and svo or code numbers 155 and 138.
The number of latitudes of the resulting Gaussian grid is calculated 
from the triangular truncation by:
@IfMan

   nlat = NINT((trunc*3 + 1.)/2.)
@EndifMan
@IfDoc
\\
@BeginMath
   \mbox{nlat} = NINT((\mbox{trunc}*\fbox{3} + 1.)/2.)

@BeginOperator_uv2dv
@Title     = U and V wind to divergence and vorticity

@BeginDescription
Calculate spherical harmonic coefficients of relative divergence and vorticity
from U and V wind. The U and V wind need to have the names u and v or
the code numbers 131 and 132.
The triangular truncation of the resulting spherical harmonics
is calculated from the number of latitudes by:
@IfMan

   trunc = (nlat*2 - 1) / 3
@EndifMan
