@BeginOperator_uv2dv
@Title     = U and V wind to divergence and vorticity

@BeginDescription
Calculate spherical harmonic coefficients of divergence and vorticity
from U and V wind. The divergence and vorticity must have the names sd
and svo or code numbers 155 and 138.
@EndDescription
@EndOperator


@BeginOperator_dv2uv
@Title     = Divergence and vorticity to U and V wind

@BeginDescription
Calculate U and V wind on a gaussian grid from spherical harmonic 
coefficients of divergence and vorticity. The U and V wind must have
the names u and v or the code numbers 131 and 132.
@EndDescription
@EndOperator


@BeginExample
Assume a dataset has at least spherical harmonic coefficients
of divergence and vorticity.
To transform the spectral divergence and vorticity to U and V wind, use:
