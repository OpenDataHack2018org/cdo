@BeginDescription
Performs a nearest neighbor remapping on all input fields.

@Title     = Generate nearest neighbor remap weights
@Parameter = grid

@BeginDescription
Generates nearest neighbor remapping weights for the first input field and writes the result to a file.
The format of this file is netCDF following the SCRIP convention.
Use the operator @mod{remap} to apply this remapping weights to a data file with the same source grid.
@EndDescription

@BeginParameter
@Item = grid
STRING  Target grid description file or name

@BeginEnvironment
@Item = REMAP_EXTRAPOLATE
This variable is used to switch the extrapolation feature 'on' or 'off'.
By default the extrapolation is enabled for this remapping method.
@Item = CDO_REMAP_RADIUS
Remap search radius in degree, default 180 degree.
