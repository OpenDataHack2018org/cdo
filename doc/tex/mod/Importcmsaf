@BeginDescription
This operator imports gridded CM-SAF (Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring)
HDF5 files. CM-SAF exploits data from polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites in order 
to provide climate monitoring products of the following parameters: 

@IfMan
Cloud parameters: cloud fraction (CFC), cloud type (CTY), cloud phase (CPH), 
                  cloud top height, pressure and temperature (CTH,CTP,CTT), 
                  cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud water path (CWP).

Surface radiation components: Surface albedo (SAL); surface incoming (SIS) 
                  and net (SNS) shortwave radiation; surface downward (SDL) 
                  and outgoing (SOL) longwave radiation, surface net longwave 
                  radiation (SNL) and surface radiation budget (SRB).

Top-of-atmosphere radiation components: Incoming (TIS) and reflected (TRS) 
                  solar radiative flux at top-of-atmosphere. Emitted thermal 
                  radiative flux at top-of-atmosphere (TET).

Water vapour:     Vertically integrated water vapour (HTW), layered vertically 
                  integrated water vapour and layer mean temperature and relative 
                  humidity for 5 layers (HLW), temperature and mixing ratio at 
                  6 pressure levels.

Daily and monthly mean products can be ordered via the CM-SAF web page (www.cmsaf.eu). 
Products with higher spatial and temporal resolution, i.e. instantaneous swath-based products,
are available on request (contact.cmsaf@dwd.de). All products are distributed free-of-charge.
More information on the data is available on the CM-SAF homepage (www.cmsaf.eu).

Daily and monthly mean products are provided in equal-area projections. CDO reads the 
projection parameters from the metadata in the HDF5-headers in order to allow spatial 
operations like remapping. For spatial operations with instantaneous products on original 
satellite projection, additional files with arrays of latitudes and longitudes are needed.
These can be obtained from CM-SAF together with the data.

@BeginNote
To use this operator, it is necessary to build CDO with HDF5 support (version 1.6 or higher).
The PROJ.4 library (version 4.6 or higher) is needed for full support of the remapping
functionality. 
@EndNote


@BeginExample
@C To convert a CM-SAF HDF5 file to NetCDF use:
@C @BeginVerbatim
@C    cdo -f nc import_cmsaf ifile.h5 ofile.nc
@C @EndVerbatim
A typical sequence of commands with this operator could look like this:
@BeginVerbatim
cdo -f nc remapbil,r360x180 -import_cmsaf cmsaf_product.hdf output.nc
@EndVerbatim
(bilinear remapping to a predefined global grid with 1 deg resolution and conversion to NetCDF). \\

If you work with CM-SAF data on original satellite project, an additional file
with information on geolocation is required, to perform such spatial operations:
@BeginVerbatim
cdo -f nc remapbil,r720x360 -setgrid,cmsaf_latlon.h5 -import_cmsaf cmsaf.hdf out.nc
@EndVerbatim

Some CM-SAF data are stored as scaled integer values. For some operations, it
could be desirable (or necessary) to increase the accuracy of the converted
products:
@BeginVerbatim
cdo -b f32 -f nc fldmean -sellonlatbox,0,10,0,10 -remapbil,r720x360 \
                -import_cmsaf cmsaf_product.hdf output.nc
@EndVerbatim
