@BeginDescription
This module performs simple arithmetic of a time series and one timestep
with the same season. For each field in @file{ifile1} the corresponding
field of the timestep in @file{ifile2} with the same season is used.
The header information in @file{ifile1} have to be the same as in @file{ifile2}.
Usually @file{ifile2} is generated by an operator of the module @mod{YSEASSTAT}.
