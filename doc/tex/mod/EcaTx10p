@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} be a time series of daily maximum temperatures TX, and
@file{ifile2} be the 10th percentile TXn10 of daily maximum temperatures
for any period used as reference. Then the percentage of time where TX < TXn10 
is calculated.
TXn10 is calculated as the 10th percentile of daily maximum temperatures of a five 
day window centred on each calendar day of a given climate reference period.
Note that both TX and TXn10 have to be givenin the same units.
The date information of a timestep in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing timestep in @file{ifile1}.

To compute the percentage of timesteps with a daily maximum temperature
smaller than the 10th percentile of the daily maximum temperatures for
a given reference period use:
