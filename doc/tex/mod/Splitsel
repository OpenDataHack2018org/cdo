@Title     = Split time selection
@Parameter = nsets [noffset] [nskip]

@BeginDescription
This operator splits @file{ifile} into pieces, one for each adjacent
sequence @math{t_1, ...., t_n} of time steps of the same selected time range.
The output files will be named @file{<obase><nnnnnn><suffix>} where @file{nnnnnn} is the 
sequence number and @file{suffix} is the filename extension derived from the file format.
@EndDescription
@EndOperator


@BeginEnvironment
@Item = CDO_FILE_SUFFIX
This environment variable can be used to set the default file suffix. This suffix will be
added to the output file names instead of the filename extension derived from the file format. 
Set this variable to NULL to disable the adding of a file suffix.
@EndEnvironment


@BeginParameter noffset
@Item = nsets
INTEGER  Number of input time steps for each output file
@Item = noffset
INTEGER  Number of input time steps skipped before the first time step range (optional)
@Item = nskip
INTEGER  Number of input time steps skipped between time step ranges (optional)
