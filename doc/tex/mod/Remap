@Parameter = grid weights

@BeginDescription
This operator remaps all input fields to a new grid. The remap type and the 
interpolation weights of one grid are read from a netCDF file. The netCDF 
file with the weights must follow the SCRIP convention. Normaly these weights 
come from a previous call to module @mod{GENWEIGHTS} or was created by the original
SCRIP package.

@BeginParameter
@Item = grid
STRING  Target grid description file or name
@Item = weights
STRING  Interpolation weights (SCRIP netCDF file)
@EndParameter


@BeginNote
For this program the author has converted the original Fortran 90 SCRIP 
software to ANSI C. In case of any problems send a bug report to CDO and
not to SCRIP!

@BeginExample
Say @file{ifile} contains fields on a regular grid.
Remap all fields bilinear to a T42 gaussian grid:
@BeginVerbatim
   cdo genbil,t42grid ifile remapweights.nc
   cdo remap,t42grid,remapweights ifile ofile
@EndVerbatim
@EndExample
