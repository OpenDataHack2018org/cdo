@BeginDescription
Let @file{ifile1} be a time series of daily maximum temperatures TX, and
@file{ifile2} be the 90th percentile TXn90 of daily maximum temperatures
for any period used as reference. Then calculated is the percentage
of time where TX > TXn90. Note that both TX and TXn90 must be given
in the same units.
The date information for a time step in @file{ofile} is the date of
the last contributing time step in @file{ifile1}.

@BeginExample
To compute the percentage of time where the daily maximum temperature
is greater than the 90th percentile of the daily maximum temperature for
a given reference period, use:
@BeginVerbatim
   cdo eca_tx90p txfile txn90file ofile
