@BeginDescription
Let @file{infile} be a time series of the daily maximum temperature TX,
then the number of days where TX < 0 @celsius is counted. Note
that TX have to be given in units of Kelvin.
The date information of a timestep in @file{outfile} is the date of
the last contributing timestep in @file{infile}.
