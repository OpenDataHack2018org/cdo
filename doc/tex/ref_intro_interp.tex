This section contains modules to interpolate datasets.
There are several operators to interpolate horizontal fields
to a new grid. Some of those operators can handle only
2D fields on a regular rectangular grid.
Vertical interpolation of 3D variables is possible from
hybrid model level to height or pressure level.
Interpolation in time is possible between time steps and
between years.
