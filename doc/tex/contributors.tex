CDO was initially written by Uwe Schulzweida.
CDO was mainly written by Uwe Schulzweida.

CDO has incorporated code from several sources. Users have contributed patches and suggestions over time. This work has been undertaken by MPIM and as been funded by MPIM.


CDO was inspired by the PINGO package and the GRIB-Modules. 
PINGO was developed by Jürgen Waszkewitz, Peter Lenzen, and Nathan Gillet in 1995 at the DKRZ, Hamburg (Germany).
CDO has a similar user interface and uses some of PINGO routines.
The GRIB-Modules was developed by 


* Procedural INterface for GRIB formatted Objects


The primary contributors to the CDO development have been: 

Uwe Schulweida
Original implementation and continuing development
Concept, design and implementation of CDO, project coordination/management, and releases.
