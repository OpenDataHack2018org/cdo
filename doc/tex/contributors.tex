* History

CDO was originally developed by Uwe Schulzweida at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M).
The MPI-M, together with the DKRZ, has a long history in the development of tools for processing climate data.
CDO was inspired by some of these tools, such as the PINGO package and the GRIB-Modules. 
PINGO was developed by Jürgen Waszkewitz, Peter Lenzen, and Nathan Gillet in 1995 at the DKRZ, Hamburg (Germany).
CDO has a similar user interface and uses some of PINGO routines.
The GRIB-Modules was developed by 

* External sources

CDO has incorporated code from several sources:

afterburner is a postprocessing program for ECHAM data and ECMWF analysis data,
originally developed by Edilbert Kirk, Michael Ponater and Arno Hellbach.
The afterburner code was modified for the CDO opertors after, sp2gp, gp2sp.

SCRIP is a software package used to generate interpolation weights for remapping
fields from one grid to another in spherical geometry.
It was developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory by Philip W. Jones.
The SCRIP library was converted from Fortran to ANSI C and is used a
the base for the remapping operators in CDO.

YAC (Yet Another Coupler) was jointly developed by DKRZ and MPI-M by Moritz Hanke and Rene Redler.
CDO is using the clipping routines for the conservative remapping with remapycon.

CDO uses tools from the GNU project, including automake, and libtool.

Please let me know if your name was omitted!

CDO would not be what it is today without the invaluable help of these people, who contributed by donating code, bug fixes and documentation:
Helmut Haak,
Renate Brokopf,
Traute, 
Thomas Jahns,
