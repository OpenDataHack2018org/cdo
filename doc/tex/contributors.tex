Contributors

The primary contributors to CDO development have been: 

Uwe Schulweida

eca_gsl: adjust implementation to fit definition by ECA

Cedrick Ansorge

He worked on the CDO software package as a student assistant at MPI-M from 2007-2011.
His main contributions are the implementation of {time series filters} and {empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs)} in two and three dimensions. 
As part of the implementation of EOFs he implemented a parallel variable precision method for eigen-value computation based on a one-sided 
Jacobi annihilation scheme. 
Also he built in a parallel version of merge-sort and ensemble skill scores such as the {Brier-Score} \texttt{ensbrs} and
{cumulative ranked probability score} \texttt{enscrps}.
Some minor contributions relate to grid-handling and interpolation. For instance, the operators \texttt{maskregion} and \texttt{smooth9} 
were partly implemented by Cedrick Ansorge.
