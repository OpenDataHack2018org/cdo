\section{History}

{\CDO} was originally developed by Uwe Schulzweida at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M).
The MPI-M, together with the DKRZ, has a long history in the development of tools for processing climate data.
{\CDO} was inspired by some of these tools, such as the PINGO package and the GRIB-Modules.

PINGO\footnote{Procedural INterface for GRIB formatted Objects} was developed by J\"urgen Waszkewitz,
 Peter Lenzen, and Nathan Gillet in 1995 at the DKRZ, Hamburg (Germany).
{\CDO} has a similar user interface and uses some of the PINGO routines.

The GRIB-Modules was developed by Heiko Borgert and Wolfgang Welke in 1991 at the MPI-M.
{\CDO} is using a similar module structure and also some of the routines.

\section{External sources}

{\CDO} has incorporated code from several sources:

\begin{description}
\item[afterburner] is a postprocessing program for ECHAM data and ECMWF analysis data,
originally developed by Edilbert Kirk, Michael Ponater and Arno Hellbach.
The afterburner code was modified for the {\CDO} opertors  {\htmlref{after}{after}},  {\htmlref{sp2gp}{sp2gp}},  {\htmlref{gp2sp}{gp2sp}}.

\item[SCRIP] is a software package used to generate interpolation weights for remapping
fields from one grid to another in spherical geometry \cite{SCRIP}.
It was developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory by Philip W. Jones.
The SCRIP library was converted from Fortran to ANSI C and is used as
the base for the remapping operators in {\CDO}.

\item[YAC] (Yet Another Coupler) was jointly developed by DKRZ and MPI-M by Moritz Hanke and Rene Redler \cite{YAC}.
{\CDO} is using the clipping routines for the conservative remapping with {\htmlref{remapycon}{remapycon}}.

\item[libkdtree] a C99 implementation of the kd-tree algorithm developed by J\"org Dietrich.
\end{description}

{\CDO} uses tools from the GNU project, including automake, and libtool. 

\section{Contributors}

The primary contributors to the {\CDO} development have been: 

\begin{description}
\item[Uwe Schulweida]: Concept, design and implementation of {\CDO}, project coordination, and releases.

\item[Luis Kornblueh]: He supports {\CDO} from the beginning. 
His main contributions are GRIB performance and compression, GME and unstructured grid support.
Luis also helps with design and planning.

\item[Ralf M\"uller]: He is working on {\CDO} since 2009. 
His main contributions are the implementation of the User Portal, 
the ruby and python interface for all {\CDO} operators, the building process and the Windows support.
The {\CDO} User Portal was funded by the European Commission infracstructure project IS-ENES.
Ralf also helps a lot with the user support.
Implemented operators: {\htmlref{showunit}{showunit}}, {\htmlref{stdatm}{stdatm}}, {\htmlref{intlevel3d}{intlevel3d}}, {\htmlref{consecsum}{consecsum}},
{\htmlref{consects}{consects}}, {\htmlref{ngrids}{ngrids}}, {\htmlref{ngridpoints}{ngridpoints}}, {\htmlref{reducegrid}{reducegrid}}
% Webpage, ruby and python interface <------------------

\item[Cedrick Ansorge]: He worked on the {\CDO} software package as a student assistant at MPI-M from 2007-2011.
Implemented operators: {\htmlref{eof}{eof}}, {\htmlref{eof3d}{eof3d}}, {\htmlref{enscrps}{enscrps}}, {\htmlref{ensbrs}{ensbrs}},
 {\htmlref{maskregion}{maskregion}}, {\htmlref{bandpass}{bandpass}}, {\htmlref{lowpass}{lowpass}}, {\htmlref{highpass}{highpass}}, {\htmlref{smooth9}{smooth9}}

\item[Oliver Heidmann]: He worked on the {\CDO} software package as a student assistant at MPI-M from 2015-2018.

\item[Karin Meier-Fleischer]: She is working in the {\CDO} user support since 2017.

\item[Fabian Wachsmann]: He is working on {\CDO} for the CMIP6 project and is responsible for the operator cmor.

\item[Ralf Quast]: He worked on {\CDO} on behalf of the Service Gruppe Anpassung (SGA), DKRZ in 2006.
Implemented all ECA Indices of Daily Temperature and Precipitation Extremes, 
all percentile operators, module {\htmlref{YDRUNSTAT}{YDRUNSTAT}} and {\htmlref{wct}{wct}}.
% timcount, hourcount, daycount, moncount, yearcount, seascount

\item[Kameswarrao Modali]: Implemented operators: contour, shaded, grfill, vector, graph.

\item[Michal Koutek]: Implemented operators: {\htmlref{selmulti}{selmulti}}
{\htmlref{delmulti}{delmulti}}, {\htmlref{changemulti}{changemulti}}, {\htmlref{samplegrid}{samplegrid}},
{\htmlref{uvDestag}{uvDestag}}, {\htmlref{rotuvNorth}{rotuvNorth}}, {\htmlref{projuvLatLon}{projuvLatLon}}.

\item[Etienne Tourigny]: Implemented operators:  {\htmlref{setclonlatbox}{setclonlatbox}}, {\htmlref{setcindexbox}{setcindexbox}},
 {\htmlref{setvals}{setvals}}, {\htmlref{splitsel}{splitsel}}, {\htmlref{histfreq}{histfreq}}, {\htmlref{setrtoc}{setrtoc}}, {\htmlref{setrtoc2}{setrtoc2}}.
