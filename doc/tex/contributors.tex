\section{History}

{\CDO} was originally developed by Uwe Schulzweida at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M).
The MPI-M, together with the DKRZ, has a long history in the development of tools for processing climate data.
{\CDO} was inspired by some of these tools, such as the PINGO package and the GRIB-Modules.

PINGO\footnote{Procedural INterface for GRIB formatted Objects} was developed by J\"urgen Waszkewitz,
 Peter Lenzen, and Nathan Gillet in 1995 at the DKRZ, Hamburg (Germany).
{\CDO} has a similar user interface and uses some of the PINGO routines.

The GRIB-Modules was developed by Heiko Borgert and Wolfgang Welke in 1991 at the MPI-M.
{\CDO} is using a similar module structure and also some of the routines.

\section{External sources}

{\CDO} has incorporated code from several sources:

\begin{description}
\item[afterburner] is a postprocessing program for ECHAM data and ECMWF analysis data,
originally developed by Edilbert Kirk, Michael Ponater and Arno Hellbach.
The afterburner code was modified for the {\CDO} opertors  {\htmlref{after}{after}},  {\htmlref{sp2gp}{sp2gp}},  {\htmlref{gp2sp}{gp2sp}}.

\item[SCRIP] is a software package used to generate interpolation weights for remapping
fields from one grid to another in spherical geometry \cite{SCRIP}.
It was developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory by Philip W. Jones.
The SCRIP library was converted from Fortran to ANSI C and is used as
the base for the remapping operators in {\CDO}.

\item[YAC] (Yet Another Coupler) was jointly developed by DKRZ and MPI-M by Moritz Hanke and Rene Redler \cite{YAC}.
{\CDO} is using the clipping routines for the conservative remapping with remapycon.

\item[libkdtree] a C99 implementation of the kd-tree algorithm developed by J\"org Dietrich.
\end{description}

{\CDO} uses tools from the GNU project, including automake, and libtool.
